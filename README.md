### Parameters

| Parameter           | Description
|:------------------ |:-----------------------------------------------------------
| start üí•           | **REQUIRED**. `<span class="start">10/20/2022 03:00 PM</span>` <br /><br />Start date of the event. Accepts most date/time formats, e.g. `10/20/2022 03:00 PM` (12-hour format) or `20-10-2022 15:00` (24-hour format). Use numeric values to describe the date, e.g. "10/20/2022" and not textual, e.g. "October 20th, 2022". Dates in the m/d/y or d-m-y formats are disambiguated by looking at the separator between the various components: if the separator is a slash (/), then the American m/d/y is assumed; whereas if the separator is a dash (-) or a dot (.), then the European d-m-y format is assumed. If, however, the year is given in a two digit format and the separator is a dash (-, the date string is parsed as y-m-d. To avoid potential ambiguity, it's best to use ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) dates. <br /><br />Date examples: `10/20/2022 03:00 PM` or `20-10-2022 15:00` or `2022/10/20 03:00 PM` or `2022-10-20 15:00`
| end                | `<span class="end">10/20/2022 05:00 PM</span>` <br /><br />End date of the event. Accepts most date/time formats, e.g. `10/20/2022 05:00 PM` (12-hour format) or `20-10-2022 17:00` (24-hour format). Use numeric values to describe the date, e.g. "10/20/2022" and not textual, e.g. "October 20th, 2022". Dates in the m/d/y or d-m-y formats are disambiguated by looking at the separator between the various components: if the separator is a slash (/), then the American m/d/y is assumed; whereas if the separator is a dash (-) or a dot (.), then the European d-m-y format is assumed. If, however, the year is given in a two digit format and the separator is a dash (-, the date string is parsed as y-m-d. To avoid potential ambiguity, it's best to use ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) dates. <br /><br />Date examples: `10/20/2022 05:00 PM` or `20-10-2022 17:00` or `2022/10/20 05:00 PM` or `2022-10-20 17:00`. If end is not defined, the end date is automatically set to start date plus one hour.
| timezone           | `<span class="timezone">Europe/Paris</span>` <br /><br />The events time zone, e.g. Europe/Paris or America/Los_Angeles. If timezone is applied (highly recommended), date/time will be converted to Zulu time / GMT / UTC. If timezone is not applied, date/time will be parsed as is (fluid date/time). ** Please notice: We're currently using the Microsoft Events API for inserting events into Outlook.com and Office 365. Those options does not allow fluid time and a timezone is required. Explanation: The timezone parameter makes sure the date/time is correct no matter if you are in New York or Sydney. If your event has users from multiple time zones in the world, it's highly recommended to use the parameter.
| title üí•           | **REQUIRED**. `<span class="title">Title of event</span>` <br /><br />Title of the event. Single line string.
| description        | `<span class="description">Description of event</span>` <br /><br />Description of the event. Use `<br>` to separate lines. The field accepts plain text or simplified HTML. Simplified HTML is supported by calendar clients like Outlook and Apple Calendar. If the calendar client does accept HTML, the content of the field is automatically converted into readable text. Keep the description short and to the point. Link to a website for further details if the event description is long. Maximum 500 characters recommended. Reason: Most modern browsers allow an unlimited number of characters to be transferred by the browser. Internet Explorer / Edge only allows ~2000 characters. A 500 characters maximum is recommended to make sure your event is cross browser compatible.
| location           | `<span class="location">Eiffel Tower</span>` <br /><br />Event location, e.g. "Eiffel Tower, Paris".
| organizer          | `<span class="organizer">John Johnson</span>` <br /><br />Event organizer, e.g. "John Johnson". If you fill out organizer you must also include the organizer_email field. If you include an organizer and an organizer_email, the event is considered to be a "meeting" by calendar clients like Outlook. If you don't include the fields, the event is considered to be an "appointment".
| organizer_email    | `<span class="organizer_email">john@example.com</span>` <br /><br />Event organizer e-mail, e.g. "your@email.com". If you fill out organizer_email you must also include the organizer field. If you include an organizer and an organizer_email, the event is considered to be a "meeting" by calendar clients like Outlook. If you don't include the fields, the event is considered to be an "appointment".
| all_day_event      | `<span class="all_day_event">true</span>` <br /><br />All day event. Accepts `true` or `false`.
| date_format        | `<span class="date_format">MM/DD/YYYY</span>` <br /><br />The format of the date in start and end. Accepts the values `MM/DD/YYYY` or `DD/MM/YYYY` only. Lets the engine know how to handle the date, e.g. 12-hour format (MM/DD/YYYY) or 24-hour format (DD/MM/YYYY).
| alarm_reminder     | `<span class="alarm_reminder">15</span>` <br /><br />Event reminder. Trigger an event reminder e.g. "15" minutes before the event starts. Accepted input: Number. Example: Reminder "15" minutes before event starts = 15 or one day before event starts : 60 minutes x 24 hours = 1440. <br /><br />Event reminders are currently supported by: Apple Calendar, Google Calendar (using Google Events API), Outlook, Outlook.com (using Microsoft Events API)
| recurring          | `<span class="recurring">FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=2;COUNT=5</span>` <br /><br />Make the event repeat for a number of times. Please notice: The start date/time must match the recurrence rule in order to work in strict calendar systems like Outlook and Apple Calendar. <br /><br />Recurring rules are currently supported by: Apple Calendar, Google Calendar (using "Direct" and Google Events API), Office 365 (using the Microsoft Events API), Outlook, Outlook.com (using Microsoft Events API). <br /><br />On AddEvent.com you can find a brilliant RRule generator: https://www.addevent.com/documentation/add-to-calendar-button
| calname            | `<span class="calname">use-title</span>` <br /><br />Custom filenaming of the .ics file used for e.g. Outlook and Apple Calendar. If not specified the name defaults to "event.ics". Use the phrase use-title to use the title from the title parameter or enter a custom filename.
| attendees          | `<span class="attendees">joe@example.com</span>` <br /><br />Add one or multiple attendees (pre-populated) to the event. Enables the pre-populated attendee(s) to get a response from the attendee. Separate multiple attendees (email addresses) with a comma. <br /><br />Example: `<span class="attendees">joe@example.com,jack@example.com</span>`
| uid                | `<span class="uid">my-unique-id123@addevent.com</span>` <br /><br />Define your own UID for the event. If not specified, a system UID is generated. Please notice; Yahoo Calendar reports error 404 if an UID is defined. We therefore don't include UID's in Yahoo Calendar. Warning. Use this option only if it serves a purpose in your coding.
| sequence           | `<span class="sequence">3</span>` <br /><br />Sequence is the number of times your event has been changed/updated and should be used in combination with an UID. Warning. Use this option only if it serves a purpose in your coding.
| status             | `<span class="status">CONFIRMED</span>` <br /><br />Define the status parameter in the .ics file used for e.g. Outlook and Apple Calendar. <br /><br />The options can be `CONFIRMED`, `TENTATIVE`, `CANCELLED`, `NEEDS-ACTION`, `COMPLETED`, `IN-PROCESS` according to the iCalendar guidelines. <br /><br />If the value is not defined (recommended), the system defaults to "CONFIRMED". Warning. Use this option only if it serves a purpose in your coding.
| client             | `<span class="client">ACCOUNT-CLIENT-ID</span>` <br /><br />The client field refers to your account ID. If you want the domain on which your "Add to Calendar" button appears to be automatically added to your accounts list of domains, then include the client tag in the button code.
| method             | `<span class="method">PUBLISH</span>` <br /><br />If defined, a method parameter is added in the .ics file used by e.g. Outlook and Apple Calendar. If not defined, no method parameter is added in the .ics file. http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/method.html + https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2446. <br /><br />Examples of usage: `PUBLISH`, `REQUEST`, `CANCEL`, `REFRESH`. <br /><br />Warning. Use this option only if it serves a purpose in your coding.
| transp             | `<span class="transp">TRANSPARENT</span>` <br /><br />Determines whether the event appears as "free" or "busy" on the users calendar. Default value is OPAQUE (busy). <br /><br />Accepted values: `TRANSPARENT` or `OPAQUE`.

| data-render         | `<div class="addeventatc" .. data-render="inline-buttons">`<br /><br /> The attribute ensures that the options are generated and displayed at load. The attribute furthermore disables the default CSS. <br /><br />Accepted value: `inline-buttons`
